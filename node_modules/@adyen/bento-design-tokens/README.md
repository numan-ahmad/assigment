# Bento Design Tokens

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bento Design Tokens library!

The aim of this library is to maintain design consistency across various products at **Adyen**.

Design tokens are semantic values that are used in **Figma** designs and **CSS** styles.

## Style Dictionary

We have opted to use the [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) token creation tool that resides
in the `@adyen/bento-design-tokens` package.

The Style dictionary uses 3 layers of tokens:

#### Definitions - All the static literal definitions

      Example: color.grey.30

#### Aliases - Semantic layer of tokens relating to a specific context or abstraction

      Example: background-color-interacted

#### Components - Component-specific tokens are representation of every theme-able value associated with a component

      Example: toggle-checked-background-color
